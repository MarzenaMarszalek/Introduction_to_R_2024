## What is R?
R is an extremely powerful programming language, broadly used in the science for:

  - data processing
  - statistical analysis
  - production of highly-customizable, publication quality graphs
  - computer simulations
  - … and much more
  
## R installation

To install R for Windows follow the [link](https://cran.uni-muenster.de/bin/windows/base/) and then click on “Download R – *version_number* – for Windows”.  
To install R for OS X (Macs) follow the [link](https://cran.uni-muenster.de/) and then click on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”  
To install R for Linux type the lines below in the terminal. 

```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base
```
Run R. You should see a window similar to the one below. 

![](R_start.png)

It is so called **R console**. Anything written and executed within a console will be interpreted (calculated) by R and a result or message will be printed out in the console.

## Note on Programming Vocabulary
 -	**console**: the window in which you type lines of code and receive the result of the code running
 -	**input**: what you give to R to work on, such as commands, values, or files
 -	**output**: what R displays back to you, typically the result of an operation
 -	**call**: run the code or prompt the computer to produce output
 -	**function**: instruction given by us to R about what to do with our input
 -	**object**: the thing you work on in R

## R as a typical calculator
R understands standard mathematical operators: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division) and `^` (power). We can perform mathematical operations on single values – numbers, as well as other objects made up of numbers.

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 1**</span>

<span style="color: green">**Sum up all numbers from 1 to 10 using the `+` operator.**</span>  
Expected result:

```{r}
1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10
```

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 2**</span>

<span style="color: green">**Raise the result of exercise 1 to the power of 5.**</span>  
Expected result:

```{r}
55^5
```

R also provides 2 additional operators:  
  `%%` - modulus - returns the rest from the division  
  `%/%` - integer division - returns how many times one number fits into another


### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 3**<span>
<span style="color: green">**For numbers 10, 156, 557, 777 and 1055, check which are divisible by 7.**</span>  
Expected result:
```{r}
10 %% 7
156 %% 7
557 %% 7
777 %% 7
1055 %% 7
```


### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 4**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Calculate the area of a circle if the radius equals 40 meters.**</span>

*Tip: Due to its unique role in science `π` value can be obtained just by typing 'pi'*.  
Expected result:

```{r}
pi*(40^2)
```

*An advice: R uses the standard order of mathematical operations. However, it is usually a good practice to use parentheses.*

Apart from that, there are also commonly used mathematical functions as:

**`log()`** - natural logarithm  
**`log10()`** - logarithm base 10  
**`exp()`** - exponent, Euler number raised to a given power  
**`sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`** - trigonometric functions  
**`abs()`** - absolute value

You can use them by including the desired number inside the parentheses e.g. exponent of e for `exp()` or an angle in radians for any of trigonometric functions.

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 5**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Using the equation for Shannon - Wiener index and species frequencies shown below, calculate diversity for both populations separately. Which is more diverse (higher values reflect more diverse populations)?**</span>


$$
H_{SW} = \sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{p_i}\right)
$$


Where:  

- \(H_{SW}\) is the Shannon-Wiener diversity index,  
- \(S\) is the total number of species,  
- \(p_i\) is the  frequency of given species,  
- \(\ln\) is the natural logarithm.  

<center>

| Species    | Population 1| Population 2|
|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| species 1  |     0.8     |    0.2      |
| species 2  |     0.1     |    0.2      |
| species 3  |     0.1     |    0.6      |

</center>

## Variables

**Until you name something it does not exist in a computer memory!** Any outcome of the execution of a command within the console perishes when the calculation is finished, unless it is **assigned to a given name**. Named objects within the computer memory are called *variables*. You can create one by using arrows (assignement symbol) in the following manner:

`chosen_name <- object_to_be_saved`  

You can easily recall the value of the variable later on by typing its name.

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 6**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Try to save 5 as variable. Choose a variable name on your own. Then, type your variable’s name and press Enter.**</span>

Expected result:

```{r}
x <- 5
x
```

*An advice: The variable name is case sensitive and cannot contain blank spaces or start with a digit. When you want to combine several words into one name use the underscore (\_). By convention dots are used for function names and should be used with caution.*

Since the variable is saved, its name can replace the actual value in any R commands e.g. if 2 is assigned to x, both `2+3` and `x+3` would result in 5.

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 7**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Using the table from exercise 5, calculate the range of species frequencies for both populations and save them as separate variables. Then using chosen names, calculate the absolute difference between ranges. Save it to a variable called `range_diff` and call it.**</span>

Expected result:

```{r}
range1 <- 0.8-0.1
range2 <- 0.6-0.2
range_diff <- abs(range2-range1)
range_diff
```

Variables can also be **overwritten**. It is done by assigning a new object to the already used variable’s name. Remember, however, that once you overwrite the variable **the old value disappears for good**.

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 8**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Change variable `range_diff` by increasing its value by 20%. Call it.**</span>

Expected result:

```{r}
range_diff <- range_diff + (range_diff*0.20)
range_diff
```

Variables can store not only numbers. The other very popular type of data is **string**. It is a text which behaves as a single object regardless of its length. To distinguish strings from variable names R requires usage of **quotation marks** around them.

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 9**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Save your name to the variable `my_name`. Call it.**</span>

Expected result:

```{r}
my_name <- "Your_Name"
my_name
```

## Functions

One of the usual ways to deal with your data in R is to use **functions**. They are simply lines of code saved in a computer memory that perform desired operations and often return a result. Some functions are **built into R**, and some require additional tools called **libraries** to be installed. Think apps pre-loaded on your phone like a calculator or a calendar vs apps for specific uses you need to download separately. We will talk about function libraries in the next class. 

Functions we used before take only a single argument e.g. `log()` takes a number. However, it is rarely the case. List of function’s arguments and the way of usage can be found in **function’s manual**. It can be reached by typing `?` followed by the function’s name.

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 10**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Open the manual for `paste()` function.**</span>

Usually the manual consists of 7 sections:

  - **DESCRIPTION** - the aim of the function
  - **USAGE** - the syntax
  - **ARGUMENTS** - arguments passed to the function and their meaning
  - **DETAILS** - detailed description of the function behaviour
  - **VALUE** - outcome of the function
  - **REFERENCES** - often the scientific article function is based on  
  - **EXAMPLES**
  
### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 11**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Use `paste()` function to stick the following words together: 'I’m’, ‘using’ and ‘R’. Don’t forget about quotation marks.**</span>

Expected result:

```{r}
paste("I’m", "using", "R")
```

Arguments passed to functions often have their own names. Distinctive names are crucial because many functions take multiple arguments that need to be distinguished. Such named arguments are passed in the following pattern: 
`argument_name = argument_value`.

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 12**</span>

<span style="color: green">**Use the same function as above but set another argument called `sep` (separator) to  ’\_’.**</span>

Expected result:

```{r}
paste("I’m", "using", "R", sep = "_")
```

Note that the blank space was replaced with an underscore. However, where did the blank spaces in the Exercise 11 result come from? The answer is that **some arguments have their default values** that would be taken if no value is put into function.
In the above case, the default value for `sep` argument is a blank space (” “).

*An advice: It is a good practice to use argument names while calling a function. Although, R can “guess” the argument name by the order in which arguments are typed, it can work improperly when the number of arguments is not strictly defined (“…” sign in function description).*

## Vectors

Vector is a series of numbers (or strings) that are saved as a single **variable**. A new vector can be created with `c()` function in the following manner: `c(value_1,value_2,value_3,…)`.

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 13**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Create a vector containing integers from 5 to 10 and save it to a variable. Call it.**</span>

Expected result:

```{r}
v1 <- c(5:10)
v1
```

>Tip: To create a vector of consecutive integers you can type the limits of the range separated by the colon.

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 14**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Create a vector containing integers from 1 to 100 and save it to a variable `one_to_hundred`. Call it.**</span>

Expected result:

```{r}
one_to_hundred <- c(1:100)
one_to_hundred
```

*An advice: Note that concerning ranges, R is fully inclusive which means that both limits of the range will be included in the final outcome.*

To create a vector of consecutive numbers which differ by a given value, use `seq()` function. Note that the function will return a vector so there is no need to use `c()`.

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 15**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Access `seq()` manual. Using `seq()` function, create a vector of numbers between 0 and 1 that differ by 0.1.**</span>

Expected result:

```{r}
v2 <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1)
v2
```

To create a vector of repeated values, use `rep()` function.

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 16**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Access `rep()` manual by typing `?rep` in console. Using `rep()` function, create a vector consisting of 1,2 and 3 repeated 20 times. Save it as a variable` repeated`.**</span>

```{r}
repeated <- rep(x = c(1:3), times = 20)
repeated
```

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 17**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Create a vector from 1 to 4 with odd numbers typed as digits and even numbers typed as words. What is the outcome? Vector of integers or vector of strings?**</spam>

Expected result:

```{r}
v4 <- c(1, "two", 3, "four")
v4
```

## Vector machinations

Useful functions:  
**`min()`** - minimum value  
**`max()`**- maximum value  
**`sum()`** - sum up all numbers in a vector  
**`prod()`** - multiply all numbers in a vector  
**`mean()`** - average value  
**`median()`** - central value  
**`length()`** - number of elements in a vector  
**`sort()`** - sort values (default is ascending order, use decreasing argument to sort in descending order)  
**`unique()`** - return unique values  
**`round()`** - round numbers (to integers by default)  

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 18**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Having a vector `one_to_hundred` calculate its mean and median.**</span>

Expected results:

```{r}
mean(one_to_hundred)
median(one_to_hundred)
```
### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 19**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Having a vector `repeated` sort it and return unique values.**</span>

Expected results:

```{r}
sort(repeated)
unique(repeated)
```

Vectors can be also used in typical mathematical operations. However there is one important rule: **shorter vector will be repeated until it reaches length of longer one** (single number is treated as vector of length 1).

Examples:

 
```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
c(1,2,3,4) + 5   # 5 is added to each element, the same as c(1,2,3,4) + c(5,5,5,5)

```


```{r}
c(1,2,3,4) + 5  

```
```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
paste("text", seq(1:10))   # Similarly here - the shorter vector including 1 element ("text") is repeated 10 times to reach the length of the longer vector.

```

```{r}
paste("text", seq(1:10))

```

![](vector_recycling.png)

The result:

```{r}

paste(c("cat", "dog", "mouse"), seq(1:10))
```


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
c(1,2,3,4) + c(1,2)   # the same as c(1,2,3,4) + c(1,2,1,2)
```


```{r}
c(1,2,3,4) + c(1,2)
```

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 20**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Having a vector `one_to_hundred`, raise each element to the power of 3. Save it to a variable called `power_3`.**</span>

Expected result:

```{r}
power_3 <- one_to_hundred^3
power_3
```

## Accessing elements of a vector

Vector can be **subsetted** (=accessed or displayed at a specific point) in the following manner: `vector_name[element_index]`. **Index** is the position of the value in the vector, e.g. 1st, 3rd, 25th, etc. 

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 21**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Return 15th element of the vector `power_3`.**</span>

Expected result:

```{r}
power_3[15]
```

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 22**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Return 2nd to 20th element of the vector `power_3`.**</span>

*Tip: Colon can be used for ranges just as for vector creation.*

Expected result:

```{r}
power_3[2:20]
```
### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 23**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Return 15th, 30th and 45th element of the vector `power_3`.**</span>

*Tip: To obtain multiple values, put a vector instead single position index.*

Expected result:

```{r}
power_3[c(15,30,45)]
```

### <span style="color: green">**Exercise 24**</span>
<span style="color: green">**Create a vector including numbers from 1 to 10, 40 and 55. Save it to a variable. Return corresponding elements of the vector `power_3` with the use of previously saved variable.**</span>

*Tip : While creating a vector you can combine both ranges and single indexes with `c()` function.*

Expected result:

```{r}
numbers <- c(1:10, 40, 55)
power_3[numbers]
```

## Before leaving

If you want to save your code written during the class, type the commands below to save the R history.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
savehistory(file = "my_history.txt")     # saves your R history to the file "my_history.txt"
getwd()                                  # displays where the file was saved`
```
